/**
 * <code>ThrowPropsPlugin</code> allows you to simply define an initial velocity for a property 
 * (or multiple properties) as well as optional maximum and/or minimum end values and then it 
 * will calculate the appropriate landing position and plot a smooth course based on the easing 
 * equation you define (Quad.easeOut by default, as set in TweenLite). This is perfect
 * for flick-scrolling or animating things as though they are being thrown. <br /><br />
 * 
 * For example, let's say a user clicks and drags a ball and you track its velocity using an 
 * <code>ENTER_FRAME</code> handler and then when the user releases the mouse button, you'd determine 
 * the velocity but you can't do a normal tween because you don't know exactly where it should 
 * land or how long the tween should last (faster initial velocity would mean a longer duration). 
 * You need the tween to pick up exactly where the user left off so that it appears to smoothly continue 
 * moving in the same direction and at the same velocity they were dragging and then decelerate 
 * based on whatever ease you define in your tween. <br /><br />
 * 
 * Oh, and one more challenge: maybe you want the final resting value to always lie within a 
 * particular range so that things don't land way off the edge of the screen. But you don't want 
 * it to suddenly jerk to a stop when it hits the edge of the screen; instead, you want it to ease 
 * gently into place even if that means going past the landing spot briefly and easing back 
 * (if the initial velocity is fast enough to require that). The whole point is to make it look smooth. <br /><br />
 * 
 * <strong>No problem.</strong> <br /><br />
 * 
 * In its simplest form, you can pass just the initial velocity for each property like this:<br /><br /><code>
 * 
 * TweenLite.to(mc, 2, {throwProps:{x:500, y:-300}});</code><br /><br />
 * 
 * In the above example, <code>mc.x</code> will animate at 500 pixels per second initially and 
 * <code>mc.y</code> will animate at -300 pixels per second. Both will decelerate smoothly 
 * until they come to rest 2 seconds later (because the tween's duration is 2 seconds). <br /><br /> 
 * 
 * To use the <code>Strong.easeOut</code> easing equation and impose maximum and minimum boundaries on 
 * the end values, use the object syntax with the <code>max</code> and <code>min</code> special 
 * properties like this:<br /><br /><code>
 * 
 * TweenLite.to(mc, 2, {throwProps:{x:{velocity:500, max:1024, min:0}, y:{velocity:-300, max:720, min:0}}, ease:Strong.easeOut});
 * </code><br /><br />
 * 
 * Notice the nesting of the objects ({}). The <code>max</code> and <code>min</code> values refer
 * to the range for the final resting position (coordinates in this case), NOT the velocity. 
 * So <code>mc.x</code> would always land between 0 and 1024 in this case, and <code>mc.y</code> 
 * would always land between 0 and 720. If you want the target object to land on a specific value 
 * rather than within a range, simply set <code>max</code> and <code>min</code> to identical values. 
 * Also notice that you must define a <code>velocity</code> value for each property.<br /><br />
 * 
 * ThrowPropsPlugin isn't just for tweening x and y coordinates. It works with any numeric property,
 * so you could use it for spinning the <code>rotation</code> of an object as well. Or the 
 * <code>scaleX</code>/<code>scaleY</code> properties. Maybe the user drags to spin a wheel and
 * lets go and you want it to continue increasing the <code>rotation</code> at that velocity, 
 * decelerating smoothly until it stops.<br /><br />
 *  
 * One of the trickiest parts of creating a <code>throwProps</code> tween that looks fluid and natural, 
 * particularly if you're applying maximum and/or minimum values, is determining its duration. 
 * Typically it's best to have a relatively consistent level of resistance so that if the 
 * initial velocity is very fast, it takes longer for the object to come to rest compared to 
 * when the initial velocity is slower. You also may want to impose some restrictions on how long
 * a tween can last (if the user drags incredibly fast, you might not want the tween to last 200
 * seconds). The duration will also affect how far past a max/min boundary the property can potentially
 * go, so you might want to only allow a certain amount of overshoot tolerance. That's why <code>ThrowPropsPlugin</code>
 * has a few static helper methods that make managing all these variables much easier. The one you'll 
 * probably use most often is the <a href="#to()"><code>to()</code></a> method which is very similar 
 * to <code>TweenLite.to()</code> except that it doesn't have a <code>duration</code> parameter and 
 * it adds several other optional parameters. Read the <a href="#to()">docs below</a> for details.<br /><br />
 * 
 * Feel free to experiment with using different easing equations to control how the values ease into
 * place at the end. You don't need to put the "ease" special property inside the 
 * <code>throwProps</code> object. Just keep it in the same place it has always been, like:<br /><br /><code>
 * 
 * TweenLite.to(mc, 1, {throwProps:{x:500, y:-300}, ease:Strong.easeOut});</code><br /><br />
 * 
 * A unique convenience of ThrowPropsPlugin compared to most other solutions out there which use 
 * <code>ENTER_FRAME</code> loops is that everything is reverseable and you can jump to any spot 
 * in the tween immediately. So if you create several <code>throwProps</code> tweens, for example, and 
 * dump them into a TimelineLite, you could simply call <code>reverse()</code> on the timeline 
 * to watch the objects retrace their steps right back to the beginning. <br /><br />
 * 
 * <i>(note: it is best to use an <code>easeOut</code> with <code>throwProps</code> tweens, but 
 * you can vary the strength by using different flavors like <code>Strong.easeOut, Cubic.easeOut, 
 * Quad.easeOut, Back.easeOut</code>, etc.)</i><br /><br />
 * 
 * The following example creates a Sprite (<code>mc</code>), populates it with a long TextField
 * and makes it vertically draggable. Then it tracks its velocity in an <code>ENTER_FRAME</code> 
 * handler and then allows it to be thrown within the bounds defined by the <code>bounds</code> 
 * rectangle, smoothly easing into place regardless of where and how fast it is thrown:

		 * Automatically analyzes various throwProps variables (like <code>velocity</code>, <code>max</code>, <code>min</code>, 
		 * and <code>resistance</code>) and creates a TweenLite instance with the appropriate duration. You can use
		 * <code>ThrowPropsPlugin.to()</code> instead of <code>TweenLite.to()</code> to create
		 * a tween - they're identical except that <code>ThrowPropsPlugin.to()</code> doesn't have a 
		 * <code>duration</code> parameter (it figures it out for you) and it adds a few extra parameters
		 * to the end that can optionally be used to affect the duration. <br /><br />
		 * 
		 * Another key difference is that <code>ThrowPropsPlugin.to()</code> will recognize the 
		 * <code>resistance</code> special property which basically controls how quickly each 
		 * property's velocity decelerates (and consequently influences the duration of the tween). 
		 * For example, if the initial <code>velocity</code> is 500 and the <code>resistance</code> 
		 * is 300, it will decelerate much faster than if the resistance was 20. You can define
		 * a <code>resistance</code> value either for each individual property in the <code>throwProps</code> 
		 * tween like this:<br /><br /><code>
		 * 
		 * ThrowPropsPlugin.to(mc, {throwProps:{x:{velocity:500, resistance:150}, y:{velocity:-300, resistance:50}}});
		 * </code><br /><br />
		 * 
		 * <strong>OR</strong> you can define a single <code>resistance</code> value that will be used for all of the 
		 * properties in that particular <code>throwProps</code> tween like this:<br /><br /><code>
		 * 
		 * ThrowPropsPlugin.to(mc, {throwProps:{x:500, y:-300, resistance:150}}); <br /><br />
		 * 
		 * //-OR- <br /><br />
		 * 
		 * ThrowPropsPlugin.to(mc, {throwProps:{x:{velocity:500, max:800, min:0}, y:{velocity:-300, max:700, min:100}, resistance:150}});
		 * </code><br /><br /> 
		 * 
		 * <code>resistance</code> should always be a positive value, although <code>velocity</code> can be negative. 
		 * <code>resistance</code> always works against <code>velocity</code>. If no <code>resistance</code> value is 
		 * found, the <code>ThrowPropsPlugin.defaultResistance</code> value will be used. The <code>resistance</code>
		 * values merely affect the duration of the tween and can be overriden by the <code>maxDuration</code> and 
		 * <code>minDuration</code> parameters. Think of the <code>resistance</code> as more of a suggestion that 
		 * ThrowPropsPlugin uses in its calculations rather than an absolute set-in-stone value. When there are multiple
		 * properties in one throwProps tween (like <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>) and the calculated duration
		 * for each one is different, the longer duration is always preferred in order to make things animate more 
		 * smoothly.<br /><br />
		 * 
		 * You also may want to impose some restrictions on the tween's duration (if the user drags incredibly 
		 * fast, for example, you might not want the tween to last 200 seconds). Use <code>maxDuration</code> and 
		 * <code>minDuration</code> parameters for that. You can use the <code>overshootTolerance</code>
		 * parameter to set a maximum number of seconds that can be added to the tween's duration (if necessary) to 
		 * accommodate temporarily overshooting the end value before smoothly returning to it at the end of the tween. 
		 * This can happen in situations where the initial velocity would normally cause it to exceed the <code>max</code> 
		 * or <code>min</code> values. An example of this would be in the iOS (iPhone or iPad) when you flick-scroll 
		 * so quickly that the content would shoot past the end of the scroll area. Instead of jerking to a sudden stop
		 * when it reaches the edge, the content briefly glides past the max/min position and gently eases back into place. 
		 * The larger the <code>overshootTolerance</code> the more leeway the tween has to temporarily shoot past the 
		 * max/min if necessary. 
		 * 
		 * 
		 * @param target Target object whose properties the tween affects. This can be ANY object, not just a DisplayObject. 
		 * @param vars An object containing the end values of the properties you're tweening, and it must also contain a <code>throwProps</code> object. For example, to create a tween that tweens <code>mc.x</code> at an initial velocity of 500 and <code>mc.y</code> at an initial velocity of -300 and applies a <code>resistance<code> of 80 and uses the <code>Strong.easeOut</code> easing equation and calls the method <code>tweenCompleteHandler</code> when it is done, the <code>vars</code> object would look like: <code>{throwProps:{x:500, y:-300, resistance:80}, ease:Strong.easeOut, onComplete:tweenCompleteHandler}</code>.
