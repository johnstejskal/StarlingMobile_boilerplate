/**
 * <code>ThrowPropsPlugin</code> allows you to smoothly glide any property to a stop, honoring
 * an initial velocity as well as applying optional restrictions on the end value. You can define
 * a specific end value or allow it to be chosen automatically based on the initial velocity and ease
 * or you can define a max/min range or even an array of snap-to values that act as notches.  
 * <code>ThrowPropsPlugin</code> even integrates <code>VelocityTracker</code> so that you can 
 * have it "watch" certain properties to keep track of their velocities for you and then use
 * them automatically when you do a <code>throwProps</code> tween. This is perfect
 * for flick-scrolling or animating things as though they are being thrown (where momentum 
 * factors into the tween). 
 * 
 * <p>For example, let's say a user clicks and drags a ball and and then when released, the ball
 * should continue flying at the same velocity as it was just moving (so that it appears seamless), 
 * and then glide to a rest. You can't do a normal tween because you don't know exactly where it should 
 * land or how long the tween should last (faster initial velocity would usually mean a longer duration). 
 * You'd like it to decelerate based on whatever ease you define in your tween (always use 
 * some sort of easeOut, like <code>Power1.easeOut, Strong.easeOut</code>, etc.). </p>
 * 
 * <p>Maybe you want the final resting value to always land within a 
 * particular range so that the ball doesn't fly off the edge of the screen. But you don't want 
 * it to suddenly jerk to a stop when it hits the edge of the screen either; instead, you want it 
 * to ease gently into place even if that means going past the landing spot briefly and easing back 
 * (if the initial velocity is fast enough to require that). The whole point is to make it look 
 * <strong>smooth</strong>.</p>
 * 
 * <p><strong>No problem.</strong></p>
 * 
 * <p>In its simplest form, you can pass just the initial velocity for each property like this:</p><p><code>
 * 
 * TweenLite.to(mc, 2, {throwProps:{x:500, y:-300}});</code></p>
 * 
 * <p>In the above example, <code>mc.x</code> will animate at 500 pixels per second initially and 
 * <code>mc.y</code> will animate at -300 pixels per second. Both will decelerate smoothly 
 * until they come to rest 2 seconds later (because the tween's duration is 2 seconds). </p>
 * 
 * <p>To use the <code>Strong.easeOut</code> easing equation and impose maximum and minimum boundaries on 
 * the end values, use the object syntax with the <code>max</code> and <code>min</code> special 
 * properties like this:</p><p><code>
 * 
 * TweenLite.to(mc, 2, {throwProps:{x:{velocity:500, max:1024, min:0}, y:{velocity:-300, max:720, min:0}}, ease:Strong.easeOut});
 * </code></p>
 * 
 * <p>Notice the nesting of the objects ({}). The <code>max</code> and <code>min</code> values refer
 * to the range for the final resting position (coordinates in this case), <strong>not</strong> the velocity. 
 * So <code>mc.x</code> would always land between 0 and 1024 in this case, and <code>mc.y</code> 
 * would always land between 0 and 720. If you want the target object to land on a specific value 
 * rather than within a range, simply set <code>max</code> and <code>min</code> to identical values
 * or just use the <code>"end"</code> property. 
 * Also notice that you must define a <code>velocity</code> value for each property 
 * (unless you're using <code><a href="ThrowPropsPlugin.html#track()">track()</a></code> - see below for details).</p>
 * 
 * <p><strong>Valid properties for object syntax</strong></p>
 * <ul>
 * 	<li><strong>velocity</strong> : Number or <code>"auto"</code> - the initial velocity, measured in units per second (or per 
 * 					frame for frames-based tweens). You may omit velocity or just use "auto" for 
 * 					properties that are being tracked automatically using the <code><a href="ThrowPropsPlugin.html#track()">track()</a></code> method.</li>
 * 	<li><strong>min</strong> : Number - the minimum end value of the property. For example, if you don't want 
 * 					<code>x</code> to land at a value below 0, your throwProps may look like <code>{x:{velocity:-500, min:0}}</code></li>
 * 	<li><strong>max</strong> : Number - the maximum end value of the property. For example, if you don't want 
 * 					<code>x</code> to exceed 1024, your throwProps may look like <code>{x:{velocity:500, max:1024}}</code></li>
 * 	<li><strong>end</strong> : [Number | Array | Function] - if <code>end</code> is defined as a <strong>Number</strong>, the 
 * 					target will land EXACTLY there (just as if you set both the <code>max</code> and <code>min</code> to identical values). 
 * 					If <code>end</code> is defined as a numeric <strong>Array</strong>, those values will be treated like "notches" or 
 * 					"snap-to" values so that the closest one to the natural landing spot will be selected. For example, 
 * 					if <code>[0,100,200]</code> is used, and the value would have naturally landed at 141, it will use the 
 * 					closest number (100 in this case) and land there instead. If <code>end</code> is defined as a
 * 					<strong>Function</strong>, that function will be called and passed the natural landing value
 * 					as the only parameter, and your function can run whatever logic you want, and then return the 
 * 					number at which it should land. This can be useful if, for example, you have a rotational tween
 * 					and you want it to snap to 10-degree increments no matter how big or small, you could use
 * 					a function that just rounds the natural value to the closest 10-degree increment. 
 * 					So any of these are valid: <code>end:100</code> or <code>end:[0,100,200,300]</code>
 * 					or <code>end:function(n:Number):Number { return Math.round(n / 10) ~~ 10; }</code></li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>ThrowPropsPlugin isn't just for tweening x and y coordinates. It works with any numeric property,
 * so you could use it for spinning the <code>rotation</code> of an object as well. Or the 
 * <code>scaleX</code>/<code>scaleY</code> properties. Maybe the user drags to spin a wheel and
 * lets go and you want it to continue increasing the <code>rotation</code> at that velocity, 
 * decelerating smoothly until it stops. It even works with method-based getters/setters.</p>
 *  
 * <p><strong>Automatically determine duration</strong></p>
 * <p>One of the trickiest parts of creating a <code>throwProps</code> tween that looks fluid and natural 
 * (particularly if you're applying maximum and/or minimum values) is determining its duration. 
 * Typically it's best to have a relatively consistent level of resistance so that if the 
 * initial velocity is very fast, it takes longer for the object to come to rest compared to 
 * when the initial velocity is slower. You also may want to impose some restrictions on how long
 * a tween can last (if the user drags incredibly fast, you might not want the tween to last 200
 * seconds). The duration will also affect how far past a max/min boundary the property may
 * go, so you might want to only allow a certain amount of overshoot tolerance. That's why <code>ThrowPropsPlugin</code>
 * has a few static helper methods that make managing all these variables much easier. The one you'll 
 * probably use most often is the <a href="ThrowPropsPlugin.html#to()"><code>to()</code></a> method which is very similar 
 * to <code>TweenLite.to()</code> except that it doesn't have a <code>duration</code> parameter and 
 * it adds several other optional parameters. Read the <a href="ThrowPropsPlugin.html#to()">docs below</a> for details.</p><p><code>
 * 
 * ThrowPropsPlugin.to(mc, {throwProps:{x:"auto", y:{velocity:"auto", max:1000, min:0}}, ease:Strong.easeOut});</code></p>
 * 
 * <p>Feel free to experiment with using different easing equations to control how the values ease into
 * place at the end. You don't need to put the "ease" special property inside the 
 * <code>throwProps</code> object. Just keep it in the same place it has always been, like:</p><p><code>
 * 
 * TweenLite.to(mc, 1, {throwProps:{x:500, y:-300}, ease:Strong.easeOut});</code></p>
 * 
 * <p><strong>Automatically track velocity</strong></p>
 * <p>Another tricky aspect of smoothly transitioning from a particular velocity is tracking 
 * the property's velocity in the first place! So we've made that easier too - you can use the
 * <code><a href="ThrowPropsPlugin.html#track()">ThrowPropsPlugin.track()</a></code> method to have the 
 * velocity (rate of change) of certain properties tracked and then <code>throwProps</code> tweens 
 * will automatically grab the appropriate tracked value internally, allowing you to omit the 
 * <code>velocity</code> values in your tweens altogether. See the <code><a href="ThrowPropsPlugin.html#track()">track()</a></code> 
 * method's description for details. And make sure you start tracking velocity at least a half-second
 * before you need to tween because it takes a small amount of time to guage how fast something is going.</p>
 * 
 * <p>A unique convenience of ThrowPropsPlugin compared to most other solutions out there that use 
 * frame-based loops is that everything is reverseable and you can jump to any spot 
 * in the tween immediately. So if you create several <code>throwProps</code> tweens, for example, and 
 * dump them into a TimelineLite, you could simply call <code>reverse()</code> on the timeline 
 * to watch the objects retrace their steps right back to the beginning! </p>
 * 
 * <p>The following example creates a Sprite (<code>mc</code>), populates it with a long TextField
 * and makes it vertically draggable. Then it tracks its velocity and allows it to be thrown 
 * within the bounds defined by the <code>bounds</code> rectangle, smoothly easing into place 
 * regardless of where and how fast it is thrown:</p>

		 * Allows you to have the velocity of particular properties automatically tracked for you
		 * so that ThrowPropsPlugin tweens can access that data internally instead of manually calculating it
		 * and feeding it into each tween. For example, let's say there's an object that the 
		 * user interacts with by dragging it or maybe it is being tweened and then at some point you want
		 * to create a <code>throwProps</code> tween that smoothly continues that motion and glides to
		 * a rest. Normally, you'd need to write your own tracking code that records that object's <code>x</code>
		 * and <code>y</code> properties and the time stamps so that when it comes time to feed the 
		 * <code>velocity</code> into the <code>throwProps</code> tween, you'd have the necessary data to 
		 * calculate it. But let's face it: that can be cumbersome to do manually, and that's precisely why
		 * the <code>track()</code> method exists. 
		 * 
		 * <p>Just feed in the <code>target</code> and a comma-delimited list of its properties that you want
		 * tracked like this:</p><p><code>
		 * 
		 * ThrowPropsPlugin.track(obj, "x,y");</code></p>
		 * 
		 * <p>Then every time the core tweening engine updates (at whatever frame rate you're running), 
		 * the <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> values (or whichever properties you define) will be recorded 
		 * along with time stamps (it keeps a maximum of 2 of these values and continually writes over the previous
		 * ones, so don't worry about memory buildup). This even works with function-based properties like 
		 * getters and setters.</p>
		 * 
		 * <p>Then, after at least 100ms and 2 "ticks" of the core engine have elapsed (so that some data has been recorded),
		 * you can create <code>throwProps</code> tweens for those properties and omit the <code>"velocity"</code> 
		 * values and it will automatically populate them for you internally. For example:</p>
		 * 
		 * <listing version="3.0">
//first, start tracking "x" and "y":
ThrowPropsPlugin.track(obj, "x,y");
 
//then, after at least 100ms, let's smoothly tween to EXACTLY x:200, y:300
TweenLite.to(obj, 2, {throwProps:{x:{end:200}, y:{end:300}}, ease:Strong.easeOut});
 
//and if you want things to use the defaults and have obj.x and obj.y glide to a stop based on the velocity rather than setting any destination values, just use "auto":
TweenLite.to(obj, 2, {throwProps:{x:"auto", y:"auto"}, ease:Strong.easeOut});
</listing>
		 * <p>Notice that <code>"auto"</code> is a valid option when you're tracking the properties too, but 
		 * <strong>only</strong> for tracked properties.</p>
		 * 
		 * <p><strong>What kinds of properties can be tracked?</strong></p>
		 * <p>Pretty much any numeric property of any object can be tracked, including function-based ones. 
		 * For example, <code>obj.x</code> or <code>obj.rotation</code> or even <code>obj.myCustomProp()</code>. 
		 * In fact, for getters and setters that start with the 
		 * word "get" or "set" (like <code>getCustomProp()</code> and <code>setCustomProp()</code>), it will 
		 * automatically find the matching counterpart method and use the getter appropriately, so you can track
		 * the getter or setter and it'll work. You <strong>cannot</strong>, however, track custom plugin-related 
		 * values like "directionalRotation" or "autoAlpha" or "physics2D" because those aren't real properties
		 * of the object. You should instead track the real properties that those plugins affect, like "rotation" or
		 * "alpha" or "x" or "y".</p>
		 * 
		 * <p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> you should <code>untrack()</code> properties when you no longer 
		 * need them tracked in order to maximize performance and ensure things are released for garbage collection. 
		 * To untrack, simply use the <code>untrack()</code> method:</p>
		 * 
		 * <listing version="3.0">
//stop tracking all properties of obj:
ThrowPropsPlugin.untrack(obj);
 
//stop tracking only the "x" property: 
ThrowPropsPlugin.untrack(obj, "x");
 
//stop tracking "x" and "y":
ThrowPropsPlugin.untrack(obj, "x,y");

		 * found, the <code>ThrowPropsPlugin.defaultResistance</code> value will be used. The <code>resistance</code>
		 * values merely affect the duration of the tween and can be overriden by the <code>maxDuration</code> and 
		 * <code>minDuration</code> parameters. Think of the <code>resistance</code> as more of a suggestion that 
		 * ThrowPropsPlugin uses in its calculations rather than an absolute set-in-stone value. When there are multiple
		 * properties in one throwProps tween (like <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>) and the calculated duration
		 * for each one is different, the longer duration is always preferred in order to make things animate more 
		 * smoothly.</p>
		 * 
		 * <p>You also may want to impose some restrictions on the tween's duration (if the user drags incredibly 
		 * fast, for example, you might not want the tween to last 200 seconds). Use <code>maxDuration</code> and 
		 * <code>minDuration</code> parameters for that. You can use the <code>overshootTolerance</code>
		 * parameter to set a maximum number of seconds that can be added to the tween's duration (if necessary) to 
		 * accommodate temporarily overshooting the end value before smoothly returning to it at the end of the tween. 
		 * This can happen in situations where the initial velocity would normally cause it to exceed the <code>max</code> 
		 * or <code>min</code> values. An example of this would be in the iOS (iPhone or iPad) when you flick-scroll 
		 * so quickly that the content would shoot past the end of the scroll area. Instead of jerking to a sudden stop
		 * when it reaches the edge, the content briefly glides past the max/min position and gently eases back into place. 
		 * The larger the <code>overshootTolerance</code> the more leeway the tween has to temporarily shoot past the 
		 * max/min if necessary. </p>
		 * 
		 * <p>If you'd like to have ThrowPropsPlugin automatically track the velocity of certain properties for you
		 * and auto-populate them internally so that you don't have to pass <code>velocity</code> values in, 
		 * use the <code><a href="ThrowPropsPlugin.html#track()">track()</a></code> method.</p>
		 * 
		 * <p><strong>Valid properties for object syntax</strong></p>
		 * <ul>
		 * 	<li><strong>velocity</strong> : Number or <code>"auto"</code> - the initial velocity, measured in units per second (or per 
		 * 					frame for frames-based tweens). You may omit velocity or just use "auto" for 
		 * 					properties that are being tracked automatically using the <code><a href="ThrowPropsPlugin.html#track()">track()</a></code> method.</li>
		 * 	<li><strong>min</strong> : Number - the minimum end value of the property. For example, if you don't want 
		 * 					<code>x</code> to land at a value below 0, your throwProps may look like <code>{x:{velocity:-500, min:0}}</code></li>
		 * 	<li><strong>max</strong> : Number - the maximum end value of the property. For example, if you don't want 
		 * 					<code>x</code> to exceed 1024, your throwProps may look like <code>{x:{velocity:500, max:1024}}</code></li>
		 * 	<li><strong>end</strong> : [Number | Array | Function] - if <code>end</code> is defined as a <strong>Number</strong>, the 
		 * 					target will land EXACTLY there (just as if you set both the <code>max</code> and <code>min</code> to identical values). 
		 * 					If <code>end</code> is defined as a numeric <strong>Array</strong>, those values will be treated like "notches" or 
		 * 					"snap-to" values so that the closest one to the natural landing spot will be selected. For example, 
		 * 					if <code>[0,100,200]</code> is used, and the value would have naturally landed at 141, it will use the 
		 * 					closest number (100 in this case) and land there instead. If <code>end</code> is defined as a
		 * 					<strong>Function</strong>, that function will be called and passed the natural landing value
		 * 					as the only parameter, and your function can run whatever logic you want, and then return the 
		 * 					number at which it should land. This can be useful if, for example, you have a rotational tween
		 * 					and you want it to snap to 10-degree increments no matter how big or small, you could use
		 * 					a function that just rounds the natural value to the closest 10-degree increment. 
		 * 					So any of these are valid: <code>end:100</code> or <code>end:[0,100,200,300]</code>
		 * 					or <code>end:function(n:Number):Number { return Math.round(n / 10) ~~ 10; }</code></li>
		 *	<li><strong>resistance</strong> : Number - think of resistance like the rate of velocity decay. 
		 * 					If no <code>resistance</code> value is found, the <code>ThrowPropsPlugin.defaultResistance</code> 
		 * 					value will be used. The <code>resistance</code> values merely affect the duration of the tween 
		 * 					and can be overriden by the <code>maxDuration</code> and <code>minDuration</code> parameters.</li>
